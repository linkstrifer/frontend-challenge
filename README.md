# Double Nines Code Challenge

This exercise aims to show us your code style and experience. We will be putting the focus on:

- how do you resolve the problem.
- how do you name the things.
- how do you define the functions.
- how you test.
- how you document.
- how do you use GIT and your commit styling.

In this repository you will find two folders, one is the REST API that you will use (you donâ€™t have to touch it), and a React empty project with the basic stuff (from create-react-app).

You can install any library you need, take in mind that we will check all your code so it will be better to **show off your skills**, try to use the least amount of libraries, that way, we will have more code to review.

## Challenge

The challenge is a comment nested section, similar to Facebook comments:

| Desktop                                               | Mobile                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |

## Project Structure

This repository is divided in three folders:

- Project: Here you'll find all the designs, assets, states and a style guide with all the colors and fonts.
- API: This is the REST API that you will use to get the comments, you don't need to touch anything here, this is just for you to have the data.
- UI: This is the React project, you will find the basic stuff to start working on the challenge.

## API Endpoints

- `GET` `/comments`: This endpoint will return all the comments.
- `POST` `/comment`: This endpoint will create a new comment.
- `POST` `/comment/:id/reply`: This endpoint will create a new reply for a comment.
- `DELETE`: `/comment/:id`: This endpoint will delete a comment.

### Comment payload

```ts
type CommentPayload = {
  content: string;
  username: string;
};
```

We will generate the user avatar images for you, so don't worry about it.

### Responses

The `/comment` and `/comment/:id/reply` endpoints will return the new comment created, in the case of the `reply`, it will return the replied comment with all the replies.

Here is the full comment response type:

```ts
type Comment = {
  id: string;
  content: string;
  createdAt: number;
  score: number;
  user: {
    avatar: string;
    username: string;
  };
  replies?: Comment[];
};
```

\*The `createdAt` is a timestamp in milliseconds.

For the `GET` `/comments` endpoint, you will get an array of comments, the response type is the same as the `Comment` type.

`DELETE` `/comment/:id` will return a 204 status code.

## How to start

- Clone this repository.
- Install the dependencies for the API and the UI.
- Start the API using `npm run start` inside the `api` folder.
- Start the UI using `npm run start` inside the `ui` folder.
- If you add tests, you can run the tests using `npm run test` inside the `ui` folder.
