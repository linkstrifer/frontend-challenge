# Double Nines Code Challenge

This exercise aims to show us your code style and experience. We will be putting the focus on:

- how do you resolve the problem.
- how do you name the things.
- how do you define the functions.
- how you test.
- how you document.
- how do you use GIT and your commit styling.

In this repository you will find two folders, one is the REST API that you will use (you donâ€™t have to touch it), and a React empty project with the basic stuff (from create-react-app).

You can install any library you need, take in mind that we will check all your code so it will be better to **show off your skills**, try to use the least amount of libraries, that way, we will have more code to review.

## Challenge

The challenge is a comment nested section, similar to Facebook comments:

## Project Structure

This repository is divided in three folders:

- Project: Here you'll find all the designs, assets, states and a style guide with all the colors and fonts.
- API: This is the REST API that you will use to get the comments, you don't need to touch anything here, this is just for you to have the data.
- React: This is the React project, you will find the basic stuff to start working on the challenge.
